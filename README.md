# <a name="design-architecture">1. What is Design and Architecture</a>

- There is no difference between design and architecture
- 'Architecture' is used in high-level context, whereas 'design' is used in low-level context. But both are part of the whole software design
- The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system
- The best option is for the development organization to recognize and avoid its own overconfidence and to start taking the quality of its software architecture seriously.
